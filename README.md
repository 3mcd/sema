- [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arzg.sema)
- Take a look at [the website](https://arzg.github.io/sema) for information on the rationale behind this theme
- The name comes from the first four letters of ‘semantic highlighting’, which is the application of language intelligence for code highlighting, rather than just syntax
- [The reddit comment where I first proposed this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/mtuld2/rustanalyzer_changelog_73/gv28qvq?context=3)
